# 🧠 First Principles Deep Learning

This project explores the **core mathematical building blocks of neural networks** — starting entirely from scratch using NumPy, and explained from first principles.

It’s designed to **demystify neural nets** by showing how every part works: from the dot product to gradient descent, all coded by hand.
