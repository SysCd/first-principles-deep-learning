# ðŸ§  First Principles Deep Learning

This project explores the **core mathematical building blocks of neural networks** â€” starting entirely from scratch using NumPy, and explained from first principles.

Itâ€™s designed to **demystify neural nets** by showing how every part works: from the dot product to gradient descent, all coded by hand with zero machine learning libraries.
